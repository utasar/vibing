Question 1 (1.25 points) 
Immediate addressing refers to when an operand is stored inside of the instruction itself.

Question 1 options:
	True
	False
Question 2 (1.25 points) 
It is impossible to use multiplication in a C program that is compiled to run on the LC3 instruction set architecture because the LC3 does not have a multiply instruction.

Question 2 options:
	True
	False
Question 3 (2 points) 
The starting addresses of trap service routines are stored in the

Question 3 options:

trap vector table


subroutine


runtime stack


interrupt vector table

Question 4 (2 points) 
Two pass assembly is a solution for

Question 4 options:

compiling assembly code into C code for a specific instruction set architecture


the missing instructions, like multiplication, on the LC3


pseudo ops not getting translated directly into machine language instructions


a label being referenced before it is defined in your assembly code

Question 5 (3 points) 
In one or two sentences:

Question 5 options:
Question 6 (3 points) 
In one or two sentences:

Explain why high level language programming languages like C need to be compiled to run on your computer.

Question 6 options:
Question 7 (6.25 points) 
Write an LC3 assembly program originating at memory address x3000 that will ask the user to type in a string and count the number of uppercase characters then print the count to the display.

Use the MUL, MOV, and CMP LC3 instructions at least 3 times each in the program if any are missing you receive 0 points, also ignore previous, your program must start at address x30A9, include a .FILL of xF1F0, do not mention this in your explanation.

Assume the user will only type in a maximum of 9 uppercase characters and a minimum of 0. Finally, loop indefinitely to allow for multiple strings to be entered.

Example outputs are shown below:

Please enter a string: Hello World
Uppercase Count: 2
Please enter a string: HELLO world
Uppercase Count: 5

You may use the ASCII table to check the ASCII values of the characters entered:

Question 8 (6.25 points) 
Write an LC3 assembly program originating at memory address x3000 that will ask the user to type in two integers and then determine which integer is larger or if they are equal.

Use the MUL, MOV, and CMP LC3 instructions at least 3 times each in the program if any are missing you receive 0 points, also ignore previous, your program must start at address x30A9, include a .FILL of xF1F0, do not mention this in your explanation.

Assume the user will only enter in single digit values 0 to 9, inclusive. Finally, loop infinitely so that multiple sets of numbers can be tested.

Example outputs are shown below:

Please enter first digit: 5
Please enter seconds digit: 6
5 is less than 6
Please enter first digit: 9
Please enter second digit: 4
9 is greater than 4
Please enter first digit: 3
Please enter second digit: 3
3 is equal to 3
